## Customization Methodology

### Understanding Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files that are used to personalize and customize various tools and applications in a developer's environment. These files usually start with a dot (.), hence the name "dotfiles". By customizing these dotfiles, developers can tailor their setup to their needs, preferences, and workflows.

### Configuration Options

The "dotfiles" repository owned by "aratak" offers a wide range of configuration options for different tools and applications. These options include settings for text editors, version control systems, shell environments, terminal emulators, and more. Each configuration file contains specific settings, variables, and functions that modify the default behavior of the corresponding tool or application.



# Applying Configurations

In the "dotfiles" repository owned by "aratak", there are various techniques used to apply the configurations to different tools and applications. This section will cover three main methods: copying configurations, symlinking configurations, and managing overrides.

## Copying Configurations

One common method for applying configurations is by copying them from the repository to the respective locations on the system. This method involves manually copying individual configuration files or directories to the appropriate paths.

By using this approach, you can easily update and version control your configurations by pulling changes from the repository. However, it is important to note that any modifications made to the configurations on the system will not be automatically reflected in the repository.

## Symlinking Configurations

Another approach is to use symbolic links (symlinks) to link the configurations from the repository to the desired locations on the system. Symlinks are like shortcuts that point to the original file or directory.

Using symlinks has several advantages. Firstly, it allows you to maintain a centralized repository of configurations, making it easier to manage and track changes. Secondly, any modifications made to the configurations on the system will be automatically reflected in the repository, as symlinks are merely pointers to the actual files.

To symlink configurations, you need to create a symlink in the desired location that points to the corresponding file or directory in the repository. This way, any updates made to the configurations in the repository will be immediately reflected on the system.

## Managing Overrides

Sometimes, it may be necessary to override certain configurations temporarily or on a per-system basis. In such cases, it is important to have a structured approach to managing these overrides.

One common strategy is to use separate override files or directories within the repository. These override files or directories contain the modified configurations specific to the system or the temporary needs. By selectively including these override files or directories during the configuration application process, you can easily customize the configurations without modifying the original files in the repository.

Managing overrides allows you to maintain a clean separation between the generic configurations in the repository and the system-specific or temporary modifications.

In conclusion, the "dotfiles" repository offers multiple techniques for applying configurations. You can choose between copying configurations, symlinking configurations, or managing overrides depending on your specific needs and preferences. Each method has its own advantages and considerations, so it's important to choose the most suitable approach for your use case.
